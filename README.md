H1. THIS IS kind-of (?) UNTESTED

I make no promises anything is accurate. My refernce kit is incomplete. My printing this you vow to essentially waste up to 1KG of filament. 
Please create issues with dimensional issues and I will correct them accordingly. 

Print standing on end w/ full supports. 

As of 02/02/23 dimensional issues have been recitifed such that feeding works as expected. Waiting on a range day.
