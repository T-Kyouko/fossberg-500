H1. THIS IS (kinda) TESTED

I make no promises anything is accurate. My reference kit is incomplete. By printing this you vow to essentially waste up to 1KG of filament. 

Print stock side down. It sits at 19.5 degrees off kilter if your slicer doens't have an automatic 'face down' option.

H2. Post processing:

Remove all supports. Ream all holes:
- Lifter: 1/4"
- FCG pin: 3/16"
- Interrupter pin: 3/16"
- Reinforcement holes: 1/8"

Reinforcement instllation:
- Cut 2x 1/8" steel dowels (available from the metal section of home depot) 1.75" in length. Mix up some JB weld epoxy and get a little in each of the holes under the ejection port. 
- Coat the dowel in JB Weld and carefully press into place. At 1.75" it should sit flush with the bottom of the scallop.
- Allow to cure before assembly.

Ejector installation:
- The square on the driver side is sized for a #4-40 nut. Similarly, since my kit did not come with an ejector screw I replaced it with a #4-40 button head screw to mate with the nut. It has so far sufficed.
- Replacement of the tiny screw as I did is advised since the small thread pitch of the OEM screw is unlikely to adhere to the plastic receiver for long.

H2. Changelog

20240413 - 
* gerald.katz motivated me to fix some things. Now it doesn't bind up.
* My kit had incomplete safety parts and according to users what I attempted doesn't even work. So this model has it deleted. Use a maverick 88 FCG if you want a cross bolt safety until I can think of something. Until then, mosin-nagant rules apply. 

20240427 -
* Fixed bolt travel and elevator issues.
* Added some chamfers to make printing use less supports

20241103 - 
* Added in 0.125" (1/8") holes along passenger side These should be reamed with a drill bit (gently) and have home-depot 1/8" dowels JB welded into place inside them. Instructions updated.
