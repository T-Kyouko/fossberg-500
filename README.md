H1. THIS IS (kinda) TESTED (Open beta?)

I make no promises anything is accurate. My refernce kit is incomplete. By printing this you vow to essentially waste up to 1KG of filament. 

Print standing on end w/ full supports.

* gerald.katz motivated me to fix some things. Now it doesn't bind up.
* My kit had incomplete safety parts and according to users what I attempted doesn't even work. So this model has it deleted. Use a maverick 88 FCG if you want a cross bolt safety until I can think of something. Until then, mosin-nagant rules apply.

* Fixed bolt travel and elevator issues.
* Added some chamfers to make printing use less supports
